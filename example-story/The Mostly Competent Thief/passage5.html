                <p>You pull yourself through the window and sink to the floor, taking a breath. Luckily, there isn't anyone in this room
                    - nor any light for that matter. After you've gathered yourself, you look around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It appears to be a storage room - there's a couple of wooden boxes stacked up taking up most of the space. You see no
                    door in the walls, but underneath one of the boxes the hint of wood peaks out amidst the stone floor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pushing the box aside reveals a trap door - this room must be accessed by ladder. That would also explain why it looks
                    like it hasn't been used in ages - who would want to bring heavy boxes up and down a ladder?
                </p>
                <p> 
                    You take a quick look in a few of the boxes, but they're just full of mildewy old tapestries - must be old decorations.
                    Well, only one way out of this room.
                </p>
