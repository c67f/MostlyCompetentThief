                Yawning, you open your eyes to the sun shining down on you. That was the best sleep you've gotten in a while - uh oh.
                You remember what you were doing. You look around, to find yourself back at the base of the hill by the tree line, and
                notice you were underneath a blanket? That mystery is solved when you notice the note pinned to the blanket - a piece of
                paper saying "Have a good night!" - as well as the embroidered symbol on the blanket...the crest of the merchant
                nobles who own the keep. Looking up at the keep, you see some of the guards looking back at you, snickering.
                </p>
                <p>Oof. Embarassing. Looks like you fell asleep trying to rob them and they gave you a blanket. Not your finest heist.
                    Maybe come back later once they've forgotten about you...a lot later
                </p>
                <p>GAME OVER</p>
